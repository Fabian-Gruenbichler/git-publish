git-publish - Easy patch submission

Preparing patches for email submission is tedious and takes multiple commands.
Revised patches need to be labelled with increasing version numbers.  Patch
series also contain a cover letter that includes a changelog for previous
versions of the series.

git-publish prepares patches consistently and stores submitted patches for
future reference.  It works with individual patches as well as patch series.
No constraints are placed on your workflow, you continue to use regular
git-branch(1) and git-checkout(1) commands.
